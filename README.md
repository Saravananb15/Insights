Prompts
Prompts serve as the foundation for the language-based inputs that guide an AI model to produce specific outputs. For those familiar with ChatGPT, a prompt might seem like merely the text entered into a dialog box that is sent to the API. 
However, it encompasses much more than that. In many AI Models, the text for the prompt is not just a simple string.

ChatGPTâ€™s API has multiple text inputs within a prompt, with each text input being assigned a role. For example, there is the system role, which tells the model how to behave and sets the context for the interaction. 
There is also the user role, which is typically the input from the user.

Crafting effective prompts is both an art and a science. ChatGPT was designed for human conversations. This is quite a departure from using something like SQL to "'ask a question.
'" One must communicate with the AI model akin to conversing with another person.

Such is the importance of this interaction style that the term "Prompt Engineering" has emerged as its own discipline. There is a burgeoning collection of techniques that improve the effectiveness of prompts. 
Investing time in crafting a prompt can drastically improve the resulting output.
